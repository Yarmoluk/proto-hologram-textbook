### 7. GOOGLE BEAM / HP (Project Starline)
**Website:** blog.google | **HQ:** Mountain View, CA | **Type:** 3D telepresence "magic window"

**Products:**
- Google Beam (formerly Project Starline): 3D telepresence display sized like a digital whiteboard with depth guard and fixed table. HP is OEM hardware partner (HP/Poly cameras, conferencing system, touch controller).

**Technology:** Combination of 3D imaging, computer vision, spatial audio, and AI depth mapping. Cameras capture the user; AI generates stereoscopic depth creating the illusion of the remote person sitting across from you.

**Status:** Select customer rollouts beginning late 2025. Not yet commercially available at scale.

**Key Stat:** 50% increase in nonverbal communication (head nods, gestures, expressions) vs traditional video calls.

**Integration:** Google Meet and Zoom compatible.

**Strengths:** Google + HP backing (unlimited resources), Google Meet/Zoom integration (massive user bases), most natural feeling of "presence" in research, enterprise-grade reliability.

**Weaknesses:** Not yet commercially available at scale. Designed ONLY for seated 1:1 conferencing — not life-size full-body holographic beaming. Pricing unknown but expected very high. Requires specialized hardware (not portable). Single-viewer experience. Cannot do events, retail, entertainment, or kiosk use cases. No standalone holographic display capability.

**Sales Objection Handler:**
> "Google Beam is the biggest long-term name in this space, but it's designed for one thing: seated video conferencing between two people. It cannot project a full-body, life-size hologram for events, retail, or entertainment. It doesn't do AI avatars, kiosk interactions, or content playback. Proto serves the full spectrum — from desktop conferencing to life-size event holograms to AI-powered retail associates — today, not 'coming soon.'"

- Odyssey 3D G90XH: 32" glasses-free 3D gaming monitor, 6K resolution, 165Hz, eye-tracking. Expected $2,000+.

**Technology:** Lenticular/eye-tracking autostereoscopic 3D for Odyssey. Anti-distortion projection optics for HoloDisplay.

**Strengths:** Global brand, massive R&D, consumer pricing trajectory, cutting-edge display tech (6K, eye-tracking).

**Weaknesses:** Consumer products only — not enterprise holographic communication. No telepresence or live beaming. HoloDisplay is literally a kitchen appliance. Odyssey is a gaming monitor. Samsung has NOT entered holographic telepresence. Single-viewer autostereoscopic 3D, not true holographic display.

**Sales Objection Handler:**
> "Samsung makes incredible displays, but their 'holographic' products are a kitchen countertop display and a gaming monitor. They have not entered the holographic telepresence or enterprise communication market. Proto is purpose-built for holographic communications, AI avatars, and enterprise deployment — a completely different category."

---

## PROTO'S FIVE COMPETITIVE MOATS

1. **Only platform combining life-size holographic presence + live two-way communication + AI avatars.** No competitor offers all three.

2. **Strongest brand portfolio in entertainment and enterprise.** UFC/Dana White, CBS, Nike, Walmart Museum, H&M, Christian Dior, Ellen DeGeneres, ESPN, 20+ Fortune 500 companies. No competitor comes close.

3. **ARHT Media's bankruptcy eliminates the most direct telepresence competitor.** Their former clients (WeWork, Paramount, Imperial College) are orphaned and looking for a replacement. Proto is the obvious choice.

4. **Broadest vertical coverage.** Healthcare (West Cancer Center, UCF Medical, TIME100 Health recognition), retail (Simon Malls), education (50+ universities), entertainment, enterprise. Competitors are siloed in one or two verticals.

5. **Full-stack platform with AI.** ProtoOS + ProtoGPT + RetailSage + fleet management + cloud CMS + developer APIs + SOC-2/HIPAA compliance. Competitors sell hardware; Proto sells a platform.

## SALES PROCESS: HANDLING COMPETITIVE OBJECTIONS

### "We're also looking at HYPERVSN"
**Response:** "HYPERVSN is excellent for advertising signage — spinning LED fans that create eye-catching floating images. But there are three things it fundamentally cannot do: (1) beam a live person into the device for two-way communication, (2) serve as an AI-powered conversational assistant, (3) display a photorealistic life-size human. If your need is digital signage only, HYPERVSN may work. If you need holographic communications, telepresence, or AI interaction — that's what Proto was built for."

### "Looking Glass is cheaper at $15K for 86 inches"
**Response:** "Looking Glass HLD 86" is a flat display mounted on a wall — it creates a 3D effect with about 2 feet of perceived depth. Proto Luma is an enclosed holographic display where a life-size person appears to stand in the room with you. The experiences are fundamentally different. Looking Glass is great for viewing 3D models. Proto delivers human presence — live beaming, AI avatars, and the emotional impact of a full-body hologram. Also, the HLD 86" doesn't ship until mid-2026. Proto ships today."

### "What about Google/HP's Project Starline?"
**Response:** "Google Beam is the most interesting long-term development in this space, and we respect what they're building. But there are key differences: (1) Google Beam is designed exclusively for seated, 1:1 video conferencing. Proto delivers full-body, life-size holograms for events, retail, healthcare, and education. (2) Google Beam is still in limited early access. Proto is deployed at 50+ universities, 20+ Fortune 500 companies, and major entertainment venues today. (3) Proto includes AI avatars, fleet management, and a content platform — Google Beam is a conferencing endpoint. Different products for different needs."

### "Holoconnects seems similar and cheaper"
**Response:** "Holoconnects makes a good product, especially for European hospitality. But look at the track record: Proto has UFC, CBS, Nike, Walmart, H&M, Christian Dior, ESPN, and 50+ universities. Holoconnects has 30 Scandinavian hotels and a hospital in Texas. Proto also offers ProtoOS with enterprise fleet management, SOC-2 Type II compliance, HIPAA alignment, and AI platforms like ProtoGPT and RetailSage. When you're deploying across multiple locations with enterprise security requirements, Proto is the proven platform."

### "Why not just use a big screen / video wall?"
**Response:** "Proto devices engage visitors for nearly 10 minutes on average — far exceeding any digital sign or video wall. The holographic effect creates an emotional response that flat screens cannot match. In healthcare, patients report feeling more connected to holographic doctors than video call doctors. In retail, the stopping power of a hologram drives foot traffic and dwell time that no flat screen achieves. This isn't an incremental improvement over video — it's a fundamentally different experience."

### "We had ARHT Media — what makes Proto different?"
**Response:** "ARHT was our most direct competitor, and they filed for bankruptcy in October 2024 because they couldn't achieve the scale to sustain operations. Proto succeeded where ARHT failed for three reasons: (1) Proto builds its own hardware — we're a full-stack platform, not dependent on third-party projection equipment. (2) Proto invested in AI with ProtoGPT and RetailSage, creating recurring value beyond one-time telepresence events. (3) Proto has diversified across education, healthcare, retail, enterprise, and entertainment — we're not dependent on any single vertical. We're happy to ensure a smooth transition for your holographic programs."

### "The price is too high"
**Response:** "Proto offers options at every level. The M2 starts at a fraction of the cost of the Luma or Epic, and we offer purchase, lease, and rental options. Consider the ROI: Proto devices engage visitors for 10 minutes on average. In retail, that dwell time converts directly to revenue. In healthcare, one holographic specialist visit to a rural clinic replaces thousands of dollars in patient travel. In education, one Proto device replaces the cost of flying in guest lecturers all year. And with ARHT's bankruptcy, Proto is the only scaled holographic telepresence provider in the market — this is the platform that enterprise buyers can commit to long-term."
