## How the Technology Works

### Display Technology
- Proto devices display 2D images/videos and create the illusion of a 3D space within a physical enclosure.
- Devices reproduce both pre-recorded video and live feeds.
- Any 4K camera (including iPhone) can be used for live "beaming."
- Content displayed against pure black background (#000000) — non-black pixels produce visual content, black pixels remain invisible, making subjects appear to float in space.
- Recommended internet speed for live beaming: 25 Mbps (both upload and download).

### Wearable-Free Experience
- Core differentiator: no VR headsets, AR glasses, or wearable devices required.
- Holographic effect visible to the naked eye.
- Accessible to anyone who walks up to the device.

### Spatial Computing Layer
- Advanced depth sensors and cameras detect position, movement, and gestures.
- Environmental awareness: holograms understand spatial context and respond intelligently.
- Dynamic perception: avatars analyze spatial context, emotional tone, and audience behavior; modify voice, expression, and posture in real-time.
- Two-way presence: mutual perception between presenters and audiences.

### AI Integration
- **Computer Vision:** Audience detection, gaze tracking, environmental analysis.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Conversational AI avatars that understand and respond to speech in real-time.
- **ProtoGPT:** Proto's conversational intelligence engine for autonomous AI hologram agents.
- **Real-Time Translation:** Multi-language support (e.g., Dana White at NocheUFC speaking fluent Spanish via AI).
- **Universal LLM Support:** Modular integration with all major large language models.

### Three-Layer Architecture
1. **Presentation Layer:** AI avatar rendering/deployment via API/SDK, programmable holographic interfaces, marketplace with pre-built solutions, no-code application development.
2. **Management Layer:** Infrastructure for scaling AI avatars across multiple spaces, full-stack platform (hardware, software, APIs), spatial OS, cloud services, CMS, app ecosystem, enterprise security (SOC-2 Type II, HIPAA-aligned).
3. **Integration Layer:** Universal infrastructure supporting all major LLMs, modular plug-and-play generative AI components, simplified API ecosystem, bridge to evolving AI services.
